Connectoid is intended to connect your Android to any remote desktop.

Currently only RDP (Terminal Services) is being worked on, but eventually I hope to add in options for VNC and NX.

**UPDATE:** My current Connectoid.interim code is not yet ready to be uploaded, but in it I have successfully been able to make a connection to an RDP server.  I want to resolve the "license" issue before I am ready to check in.

properJavaRDP-1.1 is being used as the basis of the RDP feature.
I will need to find an appropriate open java VNC and NX library.
